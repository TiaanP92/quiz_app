## Assumption and decisions made during development

-	Why a Sports Quiz App?
My decision was mainly based on interest in Sports and General knowledge. Luckily I found a few options for APIs that matched my needs. 

-	Look and Feel
I choose a clean modern look and feel trying to match what I have seen from Wyobi. The app design is very basic to make it user friendly, this also made the development process easier.

-	Why Open Trivia DB?
The Open Trivia Database provides a completely free JSON API for use in programming projects. Use of this API does not require a API Key, just generate the URL and use it in your own application to retrieve trivia questions.

-	Why flutter HTTP package for API calls?
The http package provides high-level functions and classes that allow developers to HTTP requests to web servers It provides simple and convenient way to communicate with APIs and other web services from a flutter app.

-	Why SharedPreferences package to access the local storage? 
Shared preferences in mobile development allow developers to store small amounts of data in key-value pairs on a userâ€™s device. This data is persistent and can be accessed even after the app has been closed. In Flutter, shared preferences are easily managed using the shared_preferences package.
